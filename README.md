# C++ Tutorial
## History
C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and first released in 1985. Stroustrup wanted a language similar to C but with the addition of active type checking, basic inheritance, classes, etc. C++ is used for a variety of things, including operating systems, game development, databases, and so much more.

## Installation 
In order to run C++ on Mac, I had to download XCode from the App Store. The Apple Clang compiler comes included with XCode, so there's no need to download anything else. C++ does not come with a recommended programming environment, so I will be using XCode. 
Single-line comments in C++ start with two forward slashes (//)
Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */
